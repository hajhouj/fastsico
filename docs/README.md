# Introduction

FASTSICO (for Fast String Similarity Computation) is a Java library that provides various functionalities to perform String similarity calculations. The library contains different algorithms to compute the similarity between a given string and a set of target strings. It has a user-friendly interface that allows easy selection of an OpenCL device for faster computation of similarity scores. FastSico library is capable of working with both CPU and GPU devices.

The primary objective of FASTSICO is enhancing the speed of string similarity computation for large string datasets. FASTSICO leverages the benefits of parallel computation and is capable of using both CPU and GPU via OpenCL. The library aims to provide a robust tool for developers and researchers to overcome the challenges associated with the time-consuming process of finding near-identical strings in voluminous datasets such as vocabulary files, genomic datasets, and others. The library's effectiveness lies in its ability to expedite the similarity search process and generate quick results, enabling users to handle larger datasets with greater ease and efficiency.
